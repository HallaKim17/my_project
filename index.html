    <title>Text generation with MelodyLSTM</title>

<body>

This is a page where you can generate English language with 2-layer BLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) trained on
monophonic melodies. The LSTM network contains parameters adapted to language of music. If we can generate
text sequences which somewhat resembles the structure of human language, we may conjecture that language originated
from music.
